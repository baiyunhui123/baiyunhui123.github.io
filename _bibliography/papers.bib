abstract={I argue that there is good evidence to think that `Bob wonders whether the door is open' entails that he doesn't already believe that the door is open. This is in tension with a popular position in epistemology, according to which inquiry and wondering settle at some strong epistemic state while belief is weak.},

  title={Localizing to-do lists},
  author={Bai, Yunhui and Kendrick, Jonathan Caleb},
  note={to appear},
abstract={According to certain pragmatics model, assertions update the context set and imperatives update the to-do lists of the global context. While there has been a long tradition to posit a localized context set (``the local context''), no attempt has been made to localize the to-do list. We suggest that there is a need to localize local to-do lists, making the local context a pair of local context set and local to-do lists, to explain declaratives-and-imperative conjunctions and disjunctions (e.g, `Don't plagiarize or you'd be caught').},
