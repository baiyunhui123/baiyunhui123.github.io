I'm a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Philosophy at University of Maryland, College Park](https://philosophy.umd.edu/). My main interests are in semantics, pragmatics, philosophy of language and related areas.

I'm part of the interdisciplinary research group of [Meaning at Maryland](https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/meaning-at-maryland/home), where I'm also currently the web manager.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
