I'm a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Philosophy at University of Maryland, College Park](https://philosophy.umd.edu/). My main interests are in semantics, pragmatics, philosophy of language and related areas.

I'm part of the interdisciplinary research group of [Meaning at Maryland](https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/meaning-at-maryland/home), where I'm also currently the web manager.

Feel free to reach out to me at [ybai1238@umd.edu](ybai1238@umd.edu).

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
